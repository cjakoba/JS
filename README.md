JavaScript- 
This is meant to provide a reference, to myself, on JavaScript. Not intended to be a project for display to recruiters or interviewers.

NOTES:
First introduced in the Netscape Navigator browser.
Started in the static browser.
First known as Mocha then LiveScript, then finally JavaScript.
Now can be ran practically anywhere (multiplatform).
Add ons, animations, cross platform applications (ie. slack), capabable of running on IoT devices and microcontrollers, machine learning (tensor flow js), NASA using node.js for monitoring tools.

JavaScript was standardized and became EcmaScript. Today the TC39 comitte is still responsible for adding new features and keeping the language standardized.

Flavors of JS:
- ES5
- ES6
- TypeScript (developed my MS) - gets compiled to standard JS. Is a type safe version of JS.
- CoffeeScript
- Dart

Libraries:
- JQuery - provides a richer interaction with the DOM.

JS is a dynamic programming language ran in browser that have JavaScript engines. Other non-browser environments in which JS runs includes: Node.js.

Almost everything in JS is or can be treated as an object. They have properties and methods. The DOM is an object-based representation of a webpage with its own built-in properties and methods. DOM represents HTML documents in tree-like structures. Every element or item is a node. DOM allows you to dynamically change web pages. Note that pseudo-elements like ::before or ::after are not considered part of the actual DOM.

The browser has a global object known as the window object.

Interactivity with JS involves selecting elements, manipulating elements, and listening for user actions.
