JavaScript- 
This is meant to provide a reference, to myself, on JavaScript. Not intended to be a project for display to recruiters or interviewers.

NOTES:
First introduced in the Netscape Navigator browser.
Started in the static browser.
First known as Mocha then LiveScript, then finally JavaScript.
Now can be ran practically anywhere (multiplatform).
Add ons, animations, cross platform applications (ie. slack), capabable of running on IoT devices and microcontrollers, machine learning (tensor flow js), NASA using node.js for monitoring tools.

JavaScript was standardized and became EcmaScript. Today the TC39 comitte is still responsible for adding new features and keeping the language standardized.

Flavors of JS:
- ES5
- ES6
- TypeScript (developed my MS) - gets compiled to standard JS. Is a type safe version of JS.
- CoffeeScript
- Dart
